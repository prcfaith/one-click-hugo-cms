      We worship on Sundays at 10:30am.


      Special weekday and holiday services offered throughout the year. We are committed to heart-felt, inspiring, and surprising worship! We honor the traditions of the past and seek to include contemporary elements too. Every month we create a special service with modern music and we celebrate in song regularly with the following:


      Church Choir

      Hand bell Choir

      Instrumental Soloists

      Vocalists

      Drummers

      For more information about Music at PRC, see our Music page.


      Bread shared on World Communion Sunday, 2015.


      Special services have included: Blessing of the Animals; Blessing of the Backpacks; Taize Services, The Transformative Power of Water; and many more. (See our CALENDAR for specifics on all our worship celebrations). Immediately following worship we gather for a hot lunch, coffee, tea, treats and fellowship.


      Accessibility

      The church sanctuary is wheelchair accessible. Large print bulletins are available for the visually impaired and print out sermons are available upon request for the hearing impaired.


      All are welcome!

      Our children are a vital part of our congregation. Their energy and wonder
      are infectious! They are an integral part of our worship, receive a
      special message geared just for them, and then head off to Sunday school.


      We use the Faith Alive curriculum in our Sunday school. We aim to create a safe environment where our children can express themselves, as well as question and explore how God fits into their lives.


      Sunday School


      Our classes are divided into age appropriate groups and are available from preschool thru high school. We provide a nursery for infants and toddlers in our Education Wing. Additionally, we offer confirmation classes (generally targeted towards students 15+ years old), so that they can continue to be faithful followers of Jesus.


      There are no enrollment costs. ALL youth are welcome! Our Sunday school runs from Sept-June. Children can join any time.

      Music is an extremely important part of our services. Through music, we
      aim to praise God and uplift the congregation. In addition to our own
      church Choir and Bell Choir, we occasionally bring in musicians and
      vocalists from the community to make our worship services even richer. If
      you would like to be a part of making music in the Plainview Reformed
      Church, attend a rehearsal or contact our choir director. No experience is
      required, and we would love to have you sing, dance, and play with us.


      Rehearsal dates and times are listed on our Calendar.


      Choir


      The choir is under the direction of Maureen Smith Setton. The choir rehearses on Sundays at 9:30am in the Sanctuary. We are blessed with a performance by our choir during every Sunday worship service and their special holiday programs are a joy to behold.


      Bell Choir


      The Bell Choir is under the direction of Pastor Cheri Kroon. Rehearsals are Saturdays at 11am in the Church Sanctuary. Our bell choir performs during special holiday worship services. Our next performance will be Easter Sunday!



      PRC Cafe


      In addition to the music performed in our services, we also host a monthly cafe, open to the community where musicians, poets, and artists are encouraged to share their work. The event is open to people of all faiths and is a time to grow in community while enjoying wonderful music, art, and food. For more information on the cafe, click here.
