      We worship on Sundays at 10:30am.


      Special weekday and holiday services offered throughout the year. We are committed to heart-felt, inspiring, and surprising worship! We honor the traditions of the past and seek to include contemporary elements too. Every month we create a special service with modern music and we celebrate in song regularly with the following:


      Church Choir

      Hand bell Choir

      Instrumental Soloists

      Vocalists

      Drummers

      For more information about Music at PRC, see our Music page.


      Bread shared on World Communion Sunday, 2015.


      Special services have included: Blessing of the Animals; Blessing of the Backpacks; Taize Services, The Transformative Power of Water; and many more. (See our CALENDAR for specifics on all our worship celebrations). Immediately following worship we gather for a hot lunch, coffee, tea, treats and fellowship.


      Accessibility

      The church sanctuary is wheelchair accessible. Large print bulletins are available for the visually impaired and print out sermons are available upon request for the hearing impaired.


      All are welcome!

      Single-origin coffee is coffee grown within a single known geographic
      origin. Sometimes, this is a single farm or a specific collection of beans
      from a single country. The name of the coffee is then usually the place it
      was grown to whatever degree available.

      Sustainable agriculture is farming in sustainable ways based on an
      understanding of ecosystem services, the study of relationships between
      organisms and their environment. What grows where and how it is grown are
      a matter of choice and careful consideration for nature and communities.

      We want to truly empower the communities that bring amazing coffee to you.
      That’s why we reinvest 20% of our profits into farms, local businesses and
      schools everywhere our coffee is grown. You can see the communities grow
      and learn more about coffee farming on our blog.
