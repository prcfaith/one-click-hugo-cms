blurb:
  heading: Welcome
  text: If this is your first visit to PRC, welcome! We are a small family Church
    that loves to praise and worship God. We’re a “do-it-yourself Church.” We
    delight in planning and delivering worship, in serving the sick and hungry,
    in engaging in global mission, and in supporting and educating our children.
    Most of all, we care about one another. We desire to more fully create a
    beloved community of God that connects people to people and people to God.
    Come join us. See what we are doing for the Glory of God. Welcome!
